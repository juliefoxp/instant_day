					<h2 class="font-display text-3xl pb-4"> Why instant photography?</h2>
		<p class="font-sans max-w-200 pb-20"> Instant Photography is a testament to life: It all started back in the 1940’s with a 3 year old kid. She wanted to see her fathers images right away. The father, Edwin Land, embarked on a mission: To invent instant photography. Half a decade later, Edwin Land launched Instant photography and established the Polaroid brand. Instant photography turned into big business in the 70’s and 80’s, until the digital era almost killed the industry. The massive amount of time wasted on the small screens have spurred a counterreaction: Analogue, off-line experiences have become popular again. And instant photography is just that: An analogue, life-affirming and tactile photography experience. So let’s celebrate life, and make memories:-) </p>
